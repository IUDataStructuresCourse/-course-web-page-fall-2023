# Lab 1: Basics of Testing and Debugging

## Software installation and environment set-up

+ Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) Community Edition
  - Alternatively you can use a package manager such as Homebrew: `brew install intellij-idea-ce`
  - Software like IntelliJ is often referred to as
    [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)s, 
    because they integrate a code editor, build tools and a debugger.

+ Launch the IntelliJ IDE
  - In the welcome window, click "New Project". A new project should be created for each lab.
  - In the pop-up window, enter the title of your lab assignment as "Name".
    For lab 1, it should be `SearchTest` .
  - Choose "Location", which is whatever directory that you prefer to contain
    all lab assignments. Check "Create Git repository" if you would like to use
    version control (optional).
  - Language: "Java"; build systems: "IntelliJ"
  - Install JDK. Click "Add SDK -> Download JDK" in the "JDK" drop-down menu
    ![install_jdk](resources/lab1/install_jdk.png)
  - In the pop-up window choose "Vendor" : "Oracle OpenJDK". "Version" should
    be filled in automatically (`20` as of the time of writing). 
    Make sure version $\geq 15$ . "Location" can be left as default.
