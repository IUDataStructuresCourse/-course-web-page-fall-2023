# Lab 3: Merge Sort with Linked Lists

## Overview

In this lab you are asked to implement two versions of merge sort on linked lists:
one that produces a _new_, sorted list and another that works _in-place_ by changing
the input list.

Section 7.6 of the textbook describes merge sort on an array. The steps of the algorithms are

+ split the input sequence in half
+ recursively sort the two halves
+ merge the two results into one

Youâ€™ll need to adapt the algorithm for linked lists.
The main difference between the two versions is that the sorted list is new in the first,
[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) version,
while it overwrites the input list in the second, in-place version.

**[Example 1]** The `sort` function applied to the following linked list

```
[5] -> [2] -> [7] -> [1]
```

produces the following new linked list, while leaving _the original one unchanged_:

```
[1] -> [2] -> [5] -> [7]
```

**[Example 2]** The `sort_in_place()` function applied to the following list

```
[6] -> [3] -> [8] -> [2]
```

should rearrange the nodes into the following order:

```
[2] -> [3] -> [6] -> [8]
```

## Problem Set

### Testing Merge Sort

Look at `MergeSort.java` in the student support code. Apart from `sort()` and `sort_in_place()`,
it also contains type signatures for `merge()` and `merge_in_place()`. The sort functions call
their respective merge functions to combine two sorted halves into one. Similar to their sorting
counterparts, `merge()` creates a _new_ list from two input lists while `merge_in_place()` works
in-place by rearranging the nodes.

Before implementing the two versions of merge sort, think about their correctness criteria.
Write regular, corner, and random test cases for `merge()`, `sort()`, `merge_in_place()`,
and `sort_in_place()`.
Run your test cases on Autograder against four buggy implementations and see whether they can
catch all the bugs!

### Implementing Merge Sort

Implement both `sort()` (functional) and `sort_in_place()` (in-place) in class `MergeSort`.
Both functions have a `Node`-typed parameter and `Node` return type, which point to the first node
in the input list and the first node in the output list respectively.
The `Node` class is defined in `Node.java`. As is mentioned above, they call `merge()` and
`merge_in_place()` respectively, which you are supposed to implement as well.

<!-- For example, merge applied to the following two sorted lists -->

<!-- [1] -> [2] -> [5] -> [7] -->
<!-- [2] -> [3] -> [6] -> [8] -->
<!-- produces the following newly allocated list -->

<!-- [1] -> [2] -> [2] -> [3] -> [5] -> [6] -> [7] -> [8] -->
<!-- The idea of the merge algorithm is to scan through the two input sequences, choosing the smaller of the two current elements for the output sequence. -->
