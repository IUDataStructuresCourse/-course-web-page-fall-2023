# Project 1: Flood It!

## The Game

“Flood It” is a tile coloring game played on a square board of colored tiles.

At each move, the player selects a color by clicking on one of the tiles.
The tile in the upper left corner, as well as all connected neighboring tiles of the same color,
are changed to the selected color. The objective of the game is end up with all the tiles
on the board being the same color while minimizing the number of moves.

If you haven’t played “Flood It” before, please spend some time playing the game
so that you can develop an intuition for how it works and formulate strategies
for game play before trying to implement anything. There is an [online version](http://unixpapa.com/floodit).

## Support Code and Submission

Don't worry! We have written most of the game
[here](https://github.com/IUDataStructuresCourse/flood-it-student-support-code).

Your task is to implement the `flood` function in `src/Flood.java`.
Like prior labs, test your implementation locally by adding test cases in `test/FloodTest.java`.
